Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,
the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier
Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the
Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist,
although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named
equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half
"blanket-carrying cartoon character".
